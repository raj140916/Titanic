# Titanic
Goal of this project is to create a simple regression model to predict which passengers survived on the titanic based on the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/azeembootwala/titanic

# Setup 

### Python 3
I am using python 3 for this project. Python 3 can be installed from https://www.python.org/downloads/

#### virtualenv (Optional)

Alternatively, one can set up a virtual enivronmet to use python 3 sepcifcally for the project. virtualenv can be installed using the instructions at  https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/  

once virtualenv is installed, a new environment can be created using 

```
virtualenv -p python3 envname
```



### Jupyter
The project uses Jupyter notebooks to train and test the model. Jupyter can be installed using pip as below

```
python -m pip install jupyter
```
